# Product Growth Analytics: Executive Overview

As a business owner, understanding the trajectory of your sales is crucial for making informed decisions about inventory, marketing, and expansion. Our **Product Growth API** provides a clear, data-driven window into your performance across two critical dimensions: the Present and the Future.

## 1. The Growth Metrics: Your Business Compass

We track two distinct growth markers to give you a clear picture of your business's momentum.

### A. Current Growth (The Pulse)
*   **What it represents**: Your performance in the current year compared to the last.
*   **Business Value**: Tells you if your overall sales are gaining momentum *right now*.
*   **Timeframe**: 2025 vs 2024.

### B. Predicted Growth (The Foresight)
*   **What it represents**: Our AI's prediction of how your sales will perform in the coming year compared to today.
*   **Business Value**: **This is your competitive advantage.** It allows you to anticipate demand before it happens, helping you plan your financial and operational resources effectively.
*   **Timeframe**: 2026 (Predicted) vs 2025 (Actual).

## 2. The Logic: How We Calculate Success

We use a standard, transparent formula to measure growth across all these timeframes. This ensures that a "10% growth" means the same thing whether you're looking at historical data or future predictions.

### The Standard Growth Formula:
To calculate the percentage increase or decrease, we use:

$$Growth \% = \left( \frac{\text{New Sales} - \text{Old Sales}}{\text{Old Sales}} \right) \times 100$$

### Simple Example:
If you sold **110 units** this year (New Sales) and **100 units** last year (Old Sales):
1.  Difference: $110 - 100 = 10$ extra units.
2.  Divide by original: $10 / 100 = 0.10$.
3.  Percentage: $0.10 \times 100 = \mathbf{10\% \text{ Growth}}$.

## 3. Why This Matters for Your Strategy

*   **Risk Mitigation**: By seeing "Future Growth" decline *before* it happens, you can reduce orders and free up capital.
*   **Growth Identification**: If "Current Growth" is high and "Future Growth" is even higher, you have a "Star Product" that needs aggressive inventory support.
*   **Performance Benchmarking**: See exactly which products are outperforming your business average, and which need attention.

**In short: We turn your raw sales numbers into a roadmap for your business's future.**
